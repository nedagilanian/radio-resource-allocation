# radio-resource-allocation
 This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) for Radio Resource Allocation. The project utilizes various Python libraries to simulate and analyze resource management strategies in dynamic wireless communication environments.
 
 The primary libraries used in this project include:
NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
SciPy: For scientific computing, including optimization and signal processing.
Matplotlib: For visualizing results, including plots and graphs.
Pandas: For data handling and analysis, particularly useful for working with large datasets.

This implementation aims to explore optimal allocation of radio resources under energy harvesting constraints and dynamic spectrum management.
